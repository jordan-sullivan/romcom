//When the page loads, we should see a cover with a randomly
//selected image, title, and tagline which includes two random descriptors

//our pseudocode below...
// covers are located in the assets folder
// we will need some kind of random generator:
  // that displays a selected image, a title, and a tag-line with
  //two random descriptors that cannot be the same (might need to concatenate or interpolate)

//contents:
//Cover class is in the cover.js file
//the variable covers (an array of covers, descripters, titles) are in data.js
//main is where we will edit.
//DOM features in index.html and styles.css

// Create variables targetting the relevant DOM elements here ðŸ‘‡


// We've provided a few variables below
var savedCovers = [
  //new Cover is taking in a link, a descriptor
